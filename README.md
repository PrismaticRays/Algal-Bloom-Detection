# Algal Bloom Detection
A Python program that detects any possible algae present in an image and then quantifies and visualizes its severity.

## What is it?
An application written using the Python programming language that, as its name suggests, detects algal bloom present in an image. It then quantifies the algal bloom's severity, using several vegetation/biomass indices on a per-pixel basis, and then applies a gradient on the image that represents the calculated severity.
